# Introduction to WBCS Prelims - History

This is a post that I am going to write on History as I have already discussed that specially in the Prelimis stage, History plays an important and also a decisiove role. In the selection process as it carries **50 marks** (ancient + medieval) which is one fourth of the whole preliminary paper.

The basic recommendation of the books that I would suggest include the following:
* NCERT class 11-12 (India related)
* Any class 10 bengal bord book like jibon mukhopadhay
